# CNN-for-modulation-recognition-based-on-FPGA
Here are Xueyuanâ€™s thesis work. These codes can realize:
1.	Convert I&Q dataset to constellation plot dataset.
2.	Training neural network to obtain network parameters
3.	Extract weight and bias matrixes
4.	VHDL CNN network for implementing modulation classification
